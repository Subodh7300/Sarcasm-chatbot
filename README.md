# Sarcasm Chatbot

Welcome to the Sarcasm Chatbot project! We've engineered and developed a sophisticated chatbot capable of providing witty and sarcastic responses. Our chatbot is complemented by an intuitively designed web interface that ensures smooth and engaging interactions with users.

## Key Features

### Efficient Base Architecture
We've carefully adjusted the GPT-2 base architecture with 124 million parameters to create a sarcasm-oriented generative model. This ensures that our chatbot can generate responses that are not only witty but also fully embrace the art of sarcasm.

### Huge Training Data
To train our chatbot effectively, we utilized a dataset of over 170,000 Reddit comment replies. These responses were initially refined from a pool of 1.3 million entries, all of which were specifically marked as sarcasm responses. This extensive dataset helps our chatbot understand and emulate sarcasm in its interactions.
